# x86 documentation

## Introduction
x86 is a family of instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term "x86" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in "86", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.

Many additions and extensions have been added to the x86 instruction set over the years, almost consistently with full backward compatibility. The architecture has been implemented in processors from Intel, Cyrix, AMD, VIA and many other companies; there are also open implementations, such as the Zet SoC platform. Nevertheless, of those, only Intel, AMD, and VIA hold x86 architectural licenses, and are producing modern 64-bit designs.

While x86 is the most common instruction set architecture in use, the term is not synonymous with "IBM PC compatible". Many companies, including Data General, Compaq, Zenith, NEC, Tandy, DG, Siemens Nixdorf, Commodore Business Machines, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Olivetti, and Wang Laboratories, have historically made their PC hardware based on Intel 8086/8088/80186/80286/80386/80486/Pentium/Pentium II/Pentium III/Pentium 4 microprocessors (and variants thereof), and IBM PC compatible systems are those that have a BIOS that is compatible with the IBM PC. The term is not synonymous with "Wintel" (short for "Windows on Intel"), which is a term that refers to x86-based Microsoft Windows systems regardless of whether they are built by IBM or another company.

## History
The term x86 derives from the fact that early successors to the 8086 also had names ending with "86", with where the "x" represents the manufacturer's name. The term is not synonymous with IBM PC compatibility as this implies a multitude of other computer hardware; embedded systems as well as general-purpose computers used x86 chips before the PC-compatible market started, some of them before the IBM PC itself.

The first x86-based IBM PC compatible computers were the Compaq Portable and Compaq Deskpro 386, both introduced in 1986. The first 386-based PC laptop was the Compaq SLT/286, introduced in 1988. The Compaq Deskpro 386 was thus arguably the first true IBM PC compatible computer. Similarly, the first x86-based servers were the IBM 3000 series (later renamed the IBM PC Server), which were introduced in 1988, the Intel Above Board, which was introduced in 1989, and the Intel Advanced/ZP, which was introduced in 1990. Intel's competitors also produced 386-based servers, including the Corollary C-bus Server 400, the Compaq SystemPro, the NCR System 3000, the AST Manhattan SMP, and the Dell System 310, among many others.

Today, the vast majority of PC-compatible systems are based on the x86 architecture, although not all of these necessarily implement the x86 instruction set (e.g., via the use of a hardware abstraction layer). Modern x86 is relatively uncommon in embedded systems, however, and small low power applications such as smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices typically instead use one of the ARM family of instruction set architectures (ISA). Many of the same devices are also available with an Intel branded x86 processor (e.g., smartphones with Intel Atom), but are advertised as "x86-based" rather than "x86" devices.

## Registers
The x86 architecture has 8 general-purpose registers, named AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, and SP, along with a 16-bit program counter, IP, and a 16-bit flag register, FLAGS. The registers AX, BX, CX, and DX are each 16 bits, and can be accessed as the 8-bit registers AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, and DL, respectively. The 16-bit SP register is the stack pointer, and the 16-bit BP register is the base pointer. The flag register is 16 bits wide. The flags are:

| Name | Bit | Description |
| - | - | - |
| CF | 0 | Carry flag |
| PF | 2 | Parity flag |
| AF | 4 | Adjust flag |
| ZF | 6 | Zero flag |
| SF | 7 | Sign flag |
| TF | 8 | Trap flag |
| IF | 9 | Interrupt enable flag |
| DF | 10 | Direction flag |
| OF | 11 | Overflow flag |
| IOPL | 12-13 | I/O privilege level |
| NT | 14 | Nested task flag |
| RF | 16 | Resume flag |
| VM | 17 | Virtual 8086 mode |
| AC | 18 | Alignment check |
| VIF | 19 | Virtual interrupt flag |
| VIP | 20 | Virtual interrupt pending |
| ID | 21 | ID flag |

## Instruction set
The x86 instruction set refers to the set of instructions that x86-compatible microprocessors support. The instructions are usually part of an executable program, often stored as a computer file and executed on the processor.

The x86 instruction set has been extended several times, introducing wider registers and datatypes as well as new functionality. The original 8086 instruction set, used in the x86 series of processors, was introduced in 1978. By the time of the introduction of its successor, the 80286, in 1982, it was clear that the 8086/8088 instruction set was inadequate to the task of supporting the more advanced processor design. Intel and AMD have since added several extensions to the architecture.

## Addressing modes
The x86 architecture supports several addressing modes, which can generally be used with all of the addressing methods listed above. The addressing modes are:

| Mode | Description |
| - | - |
| Register | The operand is the contents of a CPU register. |
| Immediate | The operand is a constant value. |
| Direct | The operand is the contents of a memory address. |
| Indirect | The operand is a memory address, the contents of which are used as the actual operand. |
| Base plus offset | The operand is at the memory address formed by adding a register value (often holding a memory address) and a constant value (typically an integer). |
| Base plus index | The operand is at the memory address formed by adding a register value (often holding a memory address) and a second register value (typically used as an offset). |
| Base plus index plus offset | The operand is at the memory address formed by adding a register value (often holding a memory address), a second register value (typically used as an offset), and a constant value (typically an integer). |
| Relative | The operand is a memory address, the contents of which are used as the actual operand. The address is formed by adding a constant value (typically an integer) to the instruction pointer register. |
| Relative indirect | The operand is a memory address, the contents of which are used as the actual operand. The address is formed by adding a constant value (typically an integer) to the instruction pointer register. |
| Base plus relative | The operand is at the memory address formed by adding a register value (often holding a memory address) and a constant value (typically an integer). The address is formed by adding a constant value (typically an integer) to the instruction pointer register. |
| Base plus index plus relative | The operand is at the memory address formed by adding a register value (often holding a memory address), a second register value (typically used as an offset), and a constant value (typically an integer). The address is formed by adding a constant value (typically an integer) to the instruction pointer register. |
| Base plus index plus relative plus offset | The operand is at the memory address formed by adding a register value (often holding a memory address), a second register value (typically used as an offset), a constant value (typically an integer), and a constant value (typically an integer). The address is formed by adding a constant value (typically an integer) to the instruction pointer register. |

## Instruction set extensions
The x86 instruction set has been extended several times, matching the processor's architectural change from a 16-bit architecture to a 32-bit architecture to a 64-bit architecture. The original instruction set, which is still supported by all of the modern processors, has been augmented over time with three major sets of extensions:

| Extension             | Description |
